### Design Patterns for Network Agnostic Android Apps

* How to cache effectively and also support an offline experience
	* OkHttpCore lib internally provides cache and network wrapper
	* Server send data with TTL - client use till Expiry, then ask for new
	* Content versions and decide based on HTTP 304

* PWAs
	* Prefetch when available, use when user wants it

* Facebook client side feed generation
https://code.facebook.com/posts/663139850520576/client-side-ranking-to-more-efficiently-show-people-stories-in-feed/
	* Interesting take on supporting an offline experience

* I won an adhoc quiz Uber was running in their booth - got an Uber voucher :P
	* Most engaging booth I must say.
	* Hosted a quiz on http://kahoot.it/
	* Quiz was around mobile technology

### Mobile Engineering

* Contrasting thought between web and mobile engineering
	* Mobile is typically slower, and there's this gap in the mobile world - it's pretty difficult to just update one grid
	* Apps crash while web just looks broken - when backend is changed
	* Ui is tightly coupled
	* Dynamic updates - tied to two week release cycles. 
		* Closed store model (Android and Apple stores)

* React native has a maintenance overhead
	* tech team needs to be experts at a new tech stack

* *If you allow to ship code often, you tend to ship shittier code more often*

* Need to maintain multiple live versions.
	* versioned APIs - also adds overhead
		* remote kill switch - force to update

* 87% of Apple app store apps were games
	* Games typically have stutter and issues - fps is very important
	* Perceived speed is important

* Engg culture is quite effin important
	* Can't solve something with Engg what is broken by culture
		* git is not Dropbox
		* use git bisect/hooks/pre commit etc

* What is bus factor
	* how many should be hit by a bus before your doomed
		* documentation
		* documentation
		* documentation
		* setup process docs 
		* should be obvious to a new user
		* low level bugs, sprint planning etc should be written down and be visible to everyone
		* unnecessary taking days to teach what should be self learnt

* Measure the metrics
	* data driven design
	* use them right - make the impact on perf - use new relic and bugsnag effectively
	* don't overcrowd the libs - derive insight from libs

* Effort doesn't mean progress
	* bugfix : feature ratio
	* mythical man month
	* peopleware

* Overall, I loved the take on Engg Culture. Almost a self realization, I must say!

### Solve for India with Google

* User segments
	* "Strivers" category of people are the target
	* Indian middle class
	* China has rich and poor - no middle
	* Learn middle class behaviour - look around you, everyone is a lab rat 
	* Both an opportunity and a liability

* AI, ML personalization & localisation - key aspects of such staple apps like 
	* YouTube WhatsApp Facebook

* People don't download apps 

* Firebase
* Tensor flow - hockey stick kind of growth

* We are knowledge workers - comfortable with typing etc
	* Farmer won't be 

* Crazy potential in sectors, awaiting a disruption
	* Healthcare
	* Education
	* Hyper local
	* Govt went into the app business (BHIM)
	* Fintech
	* E-governance

* App monetization - very critical
	* Waiting for disruption
	* Indians spend wisely

#### Learnings

* Insight on how B2C type mobile apps are being built.

### PWA at Myntra

* Built with React / Preact
* No Redux - started simple without data management libs
* Using LESS
* The whole PWA shebang - Service workers, pre cache, cache bust, offline experience

### Deep Learning on mobile

* FLO - app creates video stories automatically (automagically, I mean :P)
* Cannot use server side processing - too much data to transfer
* TensorFlow Lite (runs on mobile)
	* Obv highend phones - Snapdragon 820, 835+
* Science behind it - Quite Data Science heavy; terms like Quantization 

### Swifty

* Abstracts repetitive network request creation
* Creates a wrapper around the Request 
* Open sourced (Flipkart)

### Code Generation for Zombies

* Code gen is an automation that is pretty useful
* Analytics is imp in mobile apps
* Translated BI Team's excel to code 
	* Abstracted the analytics through a wrapper / abstract class / interface
* Use dialogs for manual testing - visual cues indicating success / error

### REPL Driven Mobile Development

* DAMN COOL!
* Using ClojureScript for building mobile apps
* Whacky talk
* How the developer experience with REPL is out of the world!
* Totally relate with him (based on recent trysts with Python / Notebooks)
* CLJS is a compile-to-JS lang.
* React Native FTW - make change in REPL -> Hot Reload -> Feature ready!
* Takes a completely different view to the development philosophy - forget TDD, start with the REPL.
	* That way, you've basically built functionality by look and feel.
	* No more blind coding (write, wait, compile, reload, check, refactor)

### Google Architecture Components

* Opinionated guide for building apps
* First time that Google is recommending a pattern for building Android apps
* Ex: ORM lib like wrapper for SQLite

### Chatbots

* Use API.ai, etc
* Chatbase Beta - insights on how your bot did
* Google Assistant integration

### React Native Shared Element Animations

* Delegate animations to native thread (instead of JS thread)
* https://medium.freecodecamp.org/shared-element-transition-with-react-native-159f8bc37f50

### DUS @ Flipkart

* Dynamic Update Service
* Pushes updates skipping the app store release cycles
* Differential updates, patches and chunks
* Off record - "Aur kitna optimize karu??" xD

### Testing @ BookMyShow

* Jest
* Snapshot testing

### Styled Components

* CSS-in-JS lib
* Damn cool idea
* 10k stars !

### Redux Saga

* Uses ES6 generators to make async flow easier to read write and test.
* "yield"

### Web Components

* Standard spec to define custom HTML elements/tags

* <Super-button>

* Shadow dom
* Css variables
* Can be consumed inside React/Angular

### PWA using Polymer

* Polymer is a light wrapper around the standard Web Components
* Used for the Ola PWA

### Demand Driven Architecture with GraphQL

* APIs have become the bottlenecks of apps
* GraphQL is a great way to have a data endpoint - REST is cumbersome 

### MIDI and JS

* WebRTC based orchestra - everyone connected to a channel -> sounds play on every device
* Interfacing MIDI devices using JS 
* Guy built a bunch of _toy-ish_ apps - using an accelerometer to create a dynamic color picker
