> I am Amrith Yerramilli.

- - -

Off late, I spend my weekends pulling off  _**30+ hours** hackathons_. Yes, sometimes, I go late to work on Mondays.

I'm also exploring a bunch of awesome frameworks technologies; one of which is **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)** and I'm looking forward to creating a jekyll theme based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/cover/), which I am using on [my home page](/).

It took me a while to mark my territory online, but I am here now.
I live and work in Bengaluru, India; and _clich√©d-ly_, I obsess over the amazing weather out here.

I currently work as a product engineer at [DeltaX](http://www.deltax.com/). I joined them _**2+ years**_ ago, as *computer science engineering* undergrad from [RNS Institute of Technology](http://www.rnsit.ac.in/) (**do not** click the link. I've warned you).

I am one of those [full stack developers](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=full+stack+developer), with a knack for building cool stuff. Although I enjoy working on [all layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture) of the product, I expend most of my skill designing the core structures and patterns, working with APIs, Frameworks, JavaScript and developing UI/UX. I also have a weird sceptical affinity towards mentoring - Most of the time, I just reply to queries using memes or [lmgtfy](http://lmgtfy.com/) :sweat_smile:.

Most of my technical skills revolve around web technologies. I jumped into hybrid mobile apps recently.
I'm also looking forward to exploring the native app development SDKs.

I also have a love for <i class="fa fa-car fa-lg fa-fw" title="driving"></i> <i class="fa fa-motorcycle fa-lg fa-fw" title="riding"></i> <i class="fa fa-cutlery fa-lg fa-fw" title="cooking"></i> <i class="fa fa-camera fa-lg fa-fw" title="photography"></i> <i class="fa fa-coffee fa-lg fa-fw" title="coffee"></i> <i class="fa fa-beer fa-lg fa-fw" title="hangout"></i> <i class="fa fa-futbol-o fa-lg fa-fw" title="Football"></i> <i class="fa fa-lg fa-fw fa-music" title="Music"></i>.
