Hi there! Welcome to my blog. It looks like this will be the home for some of the stuff that I decide to type out.

I'm looking forward to writing about work, cooking, philosophy, driving, and more.

<!--more-->

I haven't gotten to materializing the content for this website, but I have some ideas. I made some notes using the awesome [Google Keep](http://keep.google.com), which I will work upon. 

This website+blog may serve as proof that I may have some [gyaan](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=gyan+meaning) to dole out. I intend to write up some technical stuff revolving around the work that I've done at [DeltaX](http://www.deltax.com/).

I also have a couple of recipes up my sleeve. 

Some food for thought in general too.
